# Backtracking Puzzle

A simple implementation of a backtracking algorithm used to solve a jigsaw like puzzle

## Objective

I made this program just as a time killer mini-project, but I thought it could be useful for someone looking for backtracking examples outside of the starndard ones (eight queens, knight's tour...).
